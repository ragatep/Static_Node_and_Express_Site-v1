Teamtreehouse - Project 6<br />
Static Node and Express Site

Hello Internet.

I created this portfolio site to showcase the projects I’ve built and demonstrate that I can write “server-side” JavaScript using Node.js and Express Framework and use Pug to render web page templates to the browser.

My portfolio is a work in progress, and it contains a modern landing page with a brief description of myself and a series of project pages that show the first five projects.
